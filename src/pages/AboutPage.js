      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
      I grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia, where I cultivated a deep love for building and creating, fueled by a fascination with technology. While my passion for tech grew, I also embraced my creative side through Indian classical dance and music, tennis, piano, cooking, painting, drawing, and writing. These diverse interests have shaped my approach to problem-solving and innovation, blending technical precision with artistic expression.

        At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, my focus has been on computer engineering, where I've balanced coursework and real-world experience. I've also begun exploring my next steps in computer science at the graduate level, which aligns with my passion for developing data-driven solutions.

        Professionally, I’ve held roles at Amazon and John Deere, contributing to high-impact projects like FireTV Ads Heatmap and AutoPath. Currently, I serve as Chief Technology Officer at PrivyTrack, where I lead product development for a groundbreaking period-tracking app.

        My drive to make a positive impact extends beyond tech. In high school, I developed a passion for sustainability, which has shaped much of my work and volunteer efforts, such as my involvement with Illinois Enactus and leadership roles in tech-related student organizations.

        Outside of work, I'm on a mission to love running and continue to find joy in helping others, cooking, and exploring new creative outlets.
